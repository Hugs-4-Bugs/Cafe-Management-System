Make sure to follow this format while creating the Excel file to ensure the proper data structure. The **category_name** in the **Product** sheet should match an existing **category_name** from the **Categories** sheet for successful import.

### How to Upload Excel Data

- Navigate to the "Product Management" section of the dashboard.
- Click the "Import from Excel" button.
